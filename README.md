# [Project Name Placeholder]

## Problem Statement
[Describe the core problem this project solves in 1-2 sentences.]

## Solution Overview
[Explain the unique value proposition and how the solution works.]

## Architecture
- **Mobile**: [e.g., Flutter/React Native]
- **Backend**: [e.g., Node.js/Python]
- **AI**: [e.g., OpenAI/Gemini/DeepSeek]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL/Supabase]

## Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Mobile    | React Native / Flutter |
| Backend   | Node.js / Python |
| AI        | LangChain / Custom Logic |
| Database  | PostgreSQL / Firebase |

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up `.env` (see `.env.example`)
4. Run standard startup script: `./scripts/start.sh`

## Development Workflow
- **Parallel Development Strategy**: Teams working on Mobile, Backend, and AI concurrently.
- **AI Independence**: AI logic tested in `/ai` before integration.
- **Demo First**: Prioritizing a reliable, mock-backed demo flow.

## Folder Structure Explanation
- `/mobile`: Frontend application code
- `/backend`: API server and business logic
- `/ai`: Prompts, model interactions, and experiments
- `/shared`: Types and constants shared across apps
- `/docs`: Architecture, API contracts, and pitch materials
- `/demo`: Static data fallback for reliable demos
